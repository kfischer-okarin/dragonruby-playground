# Nokia Jam - Dark Rooms

This was the beginning of an entry for [NOKIA 3310 JAM 3](https://itch.io/jam/nokiajam3) - the idea was fleeing from some kind of
dark creature (think Alien kind of predator monster) and you have to strategically turn on/off the lights of rooms to survive and
get to the exit...

Only has randomly generated light on/off and neighboring room light states and toggling the light via space....

Experimented with Pixel arrays and how to make a tick with a lower FPS than the default 60.
