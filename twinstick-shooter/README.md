# Twinstick Shooter

This was my attempt at an entry for [Secret Santa Jam](https://itch.io/jam/secret-santa). Unfortunately I couldn't finish it properly
- and contact with my giftee was also interrupted at some time.

I experimented with creating a twinstick shooter inspired by Binding of Isaac (which I played a lot at that time) and gave the protagonist
a sonic gun kind of weapon. It was also a short dive into experimenting with audio synthesis.
