# Planet Gas Particle Mix Demo

First prototype for my [TeenyTiny DragonRuby MiniGameJam](https://itch.io/jam/teenytiny-dragonruby-minigamejam-2020) entry.

The original idea was a kind of little puzzle/experimentation game where you would specify the ratio between several kinds of Gas or Planet Material and depending on the ratios you could create different planet types - slightly inspired by Doodle God - where you would
just try out and try to get all different planet types...

In the end it was mainly an experimentation with Quaternions - and some UI programming.
